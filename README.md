## Pinoy Bingo Basics

As a rule, the game starts when all the players buy bingo tickets. A bingo ticket is a card with a 5x5 grid. 5 columns on the card correspond to 5 letters of the name of the game "B-I-N-G-O". 24 numbers per each card are random from the limits of 1 to 75. The center of the card is an empty space. After that the game begins, and the caller selects numbers at a random and calls them. As soon as the caller calls one number, all the players mark it on their tickets. The winner is determined when one or several of the players complete the winning bingo pattern. The pattern can be different depending on the hall the game is held. It can be a line, either vertical, horizontal or diagonal, a full house (when all the numbers are to be covered) or any symbol, letter or digit.

The numbers in the columns of a Bingo ticket are selected at random and printed according to the range - numbers in the B column are from 1 to 15, in the I column between 16 and 30, in the N column (that contains four numbers and the free (blank) space) between 31 and 45, in the G column between 46 and 60, and in the O column between 61 and 75.

## How to Play

1. Have the caller read out a letter-number combination. The caller should grab a letter-number combination at random, without looking, and read it out loud. Have them call out the combination a few times so everyone hears it.
   For example, if the caller pulls out a piece of paper or a ball that says "N-7" on it, they would say "N-7" out loud.
   If you're playing Bingo with pictures or words instead of letter-number combinations, have the caller read out the word or describe the picture to the other players.

2. Place a chip on your scorecard if you have that letter and number. After the caller reads out the letter-number combination, check your scorecard to see if you have the letter and number they called out. If you do, put a chip on that square.
   For example, if the caller says "G-46," you would look for the number "46" in the "G" column on your scorecard. If you have it, you'd cover that square with a chip.
   If you don't have the letter and number the caller chose, you don't have to do anything.

3. Continue playing until someone gets 5 chips in a row on their scorecard. Have the caller continue to call out different letter-number combinations. Players should keep placing chips on the squares on their scorecard whenever a corresponding letter-number combination is called.
   A player wins if they get 5 covered squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
   There's no limit to how many letter-number combinations the caller reads out. They'll keep choosing new combinations until someone wins.

4. Shout "Bingo‚Äù if you get 5 squares in a row. When a player gets 5 covered squares in a row on their scorecard, they should yell "Bingo" so everyone knows they won. When someone shouts "Bingo," the caller will stop choosing new letter-number combinations.
   If more than 1 player shouts "Bingo" after the same letter-number combination is called out, all of those players win.

5. Have everyone clear their scorecards after someone wins. Once someone has called out "Bingo" and won that round, everyone should take all the chips off their scorecards. You should always start a new game with a clear scorecard (except for the chip on the free space in the center).
